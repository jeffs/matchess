/**
 * Encapsulate mutable state behind an event-driven interface. 
 *
 * The notion of a store object is based loosely on Redux, and many of the
 * terms used here (dispatch, action, reducer, selector, etc.) are borrowed
 * from the Redux ecosystem.  However, note that this is entirely new code, and
 * the design is neither a copy nor a reimplementation of Redux.  It is not
 * meant to support Redux middleware, nor is there a `getState` method.
 *
 * The specified reducer must be a binary function accepting (1) the existing
 * state and (2) an action.  The reducer returns a new state value, which may
 * or may not differ from the old value.  The reducer must not block, mutate
 * its arguments, or have side effects.
 *
 * The reducer may accept whatever kinds of actions you find useful.  Once the
 * store has been constructed, you can pass actions to the storeâ€™s `dispatch`
 * method to have them forwarded to the reducer.  There is one exception to
 * this flexibility:  Dispatching a function (unlike any other type of action)
 * will cause the store to call that function, passing itself as an argument.
 * Such dispatched functions are often called thunks in the Redux world, and
 * they are useful for representing asynchronous operations (like network
 * calls) that do not represent immediate, atomic state changes or reducer
 * calls.
 *
 * In addition to dispatching actions (to trigger state updates by the
 * reducer), callers may subscribe listeners (i.e., callback functions) using
 * selectors.  Selectors are functions that receive the entire store state, and
 * return some value (direct or computed) from the state.  Whenever an action
 * is dispatched, causing a potential state update by the reducer, the store
 * invokes each selector to which listeners have subscribed; and if the
 * selector returns a different value than the last time it was called, its
 * listeners are passed the new value.
 *
 * Information flow is thus one-way and purely functional:  State at any time
 * results deterministically from its initial value, reducer function, and a
 * sequence of serially dispatched actions.  Thunks and listeners may have side
 * effects, but neither directly affects store state.
