    Disable horizontal scrolling.  See also:

    This site has been designed so horizontal scrolling is never necessary.  It
    does entail a lot of drag and drop gestures though, which touch-screen
    browsers sometimes mistake for scroll attempts unless we tell them not to.

    Note that this disables zooming in Firefox, but not in Safari.  It does at
    least seem to prevent mobile Safari from zooming in on `select` elements:
    When the user clicks a `select` element, mobile Safari's default behavior
    is to zoom in on the element if its text is "too small," and to leave the
    user in this strange view that they did not explicitly choose even after an
    option has been selected.  The transition is jarring, and the behavior
    potentially confusing.
