To request a move:

1. Choose the source tile.
2. Choose the target tile.

There are several ways to choose a tile:

* Enter the tile's rank and file serially via keyboard.
* Select the rank and file by clicking their labels.
* Click the tile.
* Drag the source tile onto the target tile.

The current selection can be canceled by hitting the Escape key, or by
clicking an empty tile.  { TODO: Can there be empty tiles? }

To validate a move, without actually requesting it:

1. Choose the source tile.
2. Mouse over the target tile.
   - If dragging, do not release the mouse button.
